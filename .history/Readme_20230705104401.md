1. Use Microsoft Azure as cloud service provider. The widget can be hosted using a serverless architecture such as Azure Functions. This way, you only pay for the compute time you consume, and there's no need to provision or manage servers.

2. We'd store the images in a cloud storage service - Azure Blob Storage. We'd assign each image a unique ID and use this ID to reference the image in our backend service.

3. For the machine learning part that recognizes the handwritten numbers, we'd use a pre-trained model from Azure's Cognitive Services, Azure Text Analytics.

4. We would use a queuing system such as Azure Service Bus to handle the high volume of incoming requests. This would allow us to process the requests asynchronously, ensuring the system remains responsive even under high load.

6. For storing the history of user requests, we'd use a cloud database service like Azure SQL Database
   Here we create 
   1) **Request** table with the following columns:
    - Request ID: Unique ID for each request
    - Image ID: Unique ID for each image
    - Result: The result of the request
    - Created At: The time the request was created
   2) **Image** table with the following columns:
    - Image ID: Unique ID for each image
    - Image URL: The URL where image storgate
    - Created At: The time the image was created
  
7. Restful API:
    1) Post image:


    2) Get image result:
    3) Get request history:
    4) Download image:
